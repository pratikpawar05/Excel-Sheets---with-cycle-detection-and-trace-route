# Excel-Sheets-With-Cycle-Detection

## Description

## Technologies Stack:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Data Structure ( Array, Stack, Object, etc )
- Algorithm - Graph ( DFS )

### Build a Excel Clone with features :-

- Text formatting and alignments can be applied to each cell (Two-Way Binding).
- Set formula for each cell(Support's):
  - Normal Expression's
  - Dependency Expression's
- While Formula evalutaion if algorithm detects the cycle, an alert message will pop - up. Implemented cycle detection algorithm using DFS(Depth First Search).
- Cyclic Path Can Be Traced with visualizations and cycle path can be traced back multiple times.
- Multiple Sheets Management--Add,Remove,etc.
- Cut, Copy & Paste Values in a range of cells.
